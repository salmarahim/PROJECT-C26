# INGREDIENTS

* Bread
* Eggs
* Milk – you can use your favorite milk or milk alternative in this recipe if you want to make your French toast without milk.
* Salt – add a pinch of salt to balance the flavors and sweetness
* Sweetener – you definitely have options for the sweetener to use based on your personal preferences.
* Flavorings – I love to include vanilla extract and ground cinnamon for a classic French toast flavor. You can omit the cinnamon, if you prefer or add more for a more pronounced cinnamon French Toast.
* Butter – melted on the griddle for cooking and then add a pat for serving, if desired.
* Maple syrup – real maple syrup is required in our family for the perfect French toast! You can also use a fruit syrup like my blackberry syrup if you prefer.
